# Instagram Unsave Posts!

To use this, do the next:

  - Open an browser tab and log in to your instagram account.
  - Go to your saved posts.
  - Open the collection you want to unsave from. (Can be a custom one or the one that has all saved posts.)
  - Open the post where you want to stop deleting from.
  - Open the browser's developer console and paste the contents from the file named script.js, then press enter.

Issues:

  - If you find an error while running the script, make sure your language is selected as English. (I guess you can change it I don't know.)
  - If it's the case that you can't, all you have to do is hover your mouse on the saved icon (make sure its a checked one, meaning the post is currently saved) and you will see a small black box appear saying something like "Delete", do the same for the arrow pointing to the right (the one that takes you to the next saved post.)
  - Then all you gotta do is change where it says "Delete" and "Next" in the script for the words in the black boxes you saw. (It's probably just the same words but translated to your language/account's language.)

And yes, it's just a 9 line script.
Do whatever you want with it :)
